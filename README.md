# Forecasting-Foreign-Exchange-Currency-Rates

WHAT? / GOAL : The main aim of this project is to forecast the foreign exchange currency rates of four different countries namely INDIA, BRAZIL, RUSSIA & CHINA.

HOW ? : I am going to divide the forecasting in 2 main parts. 

1. DATA EXPLORATION - Let us understand what is the data trying to tell us. Check for missing values, outliers, correlation and trends.
2. FORECASTING APPROACHES - After we have understood what the data is, let us use various forecasting methods to do our analysis.

WHY ? : Foreign Exchange Currency Rates are nowdays on a hike. At the same time, unlike stock prices foreign exchange currency rates can be affected by currency unions and politcs.

This forecasting will majorly help the brokers and business men take much better decisions, minimise their losses and maximise returns.

It will also help the government to decide on the country's GDP.
